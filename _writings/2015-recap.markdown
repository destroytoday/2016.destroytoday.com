- body: Waiting until the last possible moment to write these review posts seems to
    have become a tradition for me. This year, I decided to follow up on [last year’s
    goals](/writings/in-2015) *and* list a few new ones for 2016.
- header: Ship Cushion
  body: On July 14 of 2015, I finally shipped [Cushion](http://cushionapp.com), the
    freelancing app that has absolutely consumed my life for the past two years. The
    day [went off without a hitch](http://cushionapp.com/journal/launch/) and I watched
    as a wave of new users signed up to try it out. Ever since, I’ve been trying my
    hardest to grow it into a sustainable app that I could turn into a full-time career.
    So far, I’m about halfway there, and I’m ecstatic about Cushion’s future—especially
    this upcoming year. I plan to hire a few freelancers to help get Cushion to the
    next level, which is both exciting and terrifying.

- header: Use spreadsheets
  body: I didn’t take advantage of spreadsheets as much as I had hoped this past year,
    but I *did* use spreadsheets to manage [Cushion’s expenses page](http://cushionapp.com/expenses)
    as well as track my business expenses. After suffering through accounting software
    since I started freelancing, I pulled the plug and replaced it with spreadsheets.
    With a small amount of extra work, I have everything in a flexible format that
    doesn’t cost a dime. (I would gladly pay for a human-friendly service that focuses
    on ease and exportability.)
- header: Continue existing routines
  body: Instead of continuing my gym routine, I actually cancelled my membership and
    I haven’t been back since. I would’ve continued going if it weren’t for the gym’s
    outrageous (though not surprising) fees for pausing a membership. I did sign up
    for an indoor basketball league that starts in January, so hopefully that will
    get me back into a healthy routine.
- header: One week between client gigs
  body: I’m happy to share that I’ve gone a step further than one week between client
    gigs. Because of my focus on Cushion, I’ve been fortunate enough to take between
    1-3 months off between clients this past year. Early in the year, I worked with
    Project Florida on the Sum website (RIP). Over the summer, I reuinted with [Oak
    Studios](http://oak.is) to help with [Siteleaf 2.0](http://v2.siteleaf.com). And
    in November, I collaborated with [Casper](http://casper.com) on their fancy new
    homepage. I don’t think I’ll be as lucky in 2016, but maybe I can get Cushion
    to a point where I don’t need clients—who knows with freelancing.
- header: Book a few speaking gigs
  body: I didn’t speak at a conference in 2015, but I *did* book a speaking gig at
    [Create Upstate](http://createupstate.com) in May. I can’t wait to share what
    I’ve learned from bootstrapping Cushion and balancing freelance work while running
    an app. I hope to book a few more talks throughout the year, so if you know a
    conference that would be a good fit, [let me know](mailto:jonnie@destroytoday.com)!
- header: Take more photos
  body: I beat myself up over not taking as many photos as I once did—especially after
    digging through old hard drives and finding that even the “bad” photos are incredibly
    valuable to me years later. Going forward, I *need* to capture my life on a daily
    basis. Even if I never post the photos anywhere, I will make it a necessity to
    record at least one “experience” each day. I know I’ll regret it if I don’t.
- header: Read more books
  body: Again, I didn’t read as many books as I anticipated I would, but I *did* finish
    [The Martian](http://amzn.to/1RcVSrb) in 9 hours—a personal record! (6 of those
    hours were on a flight and I simply couldn’t put the book down after that.) For
    2016, I think I’ll have more success by establishing a reading schedule. Instead
    of picking a book and reading it whenever I remember to, I need to designate time
    throughout the week to slow down and bury my head in a good book. I’m starting
    [Ready Player One](http://amzn.to/1RcVWqX) right now, so if anyone has a suggestion
    for the next few, I’d love to hear.
- header: Play more video games
  body: In 2015, I played *plenty* of video games. It’s easy when your wife plays
    more than you. After breezing through the PS4-remastered Grand Theft Auto V, Arkham
    Knight, and quitting The Last of Us out of pure fear, I’m now deep into Assassin’s
    Creed Syndicate and Star Wars Battlefront. I don’t know what to tackle once I’m
    done with those two, but I love free roaming games.
- header: Ride my bike
  body: It pains me to say that I only rode my bike a few times in 2015. I still have
    it, so there’s always hope for 2016, but now that my studio is a short, relaxing
    walk away from our apartment, I can’t imagine I’ll start anytime soon. I should
    really plan day trips to areas of Brooklyn I’ve never been and ride there. I know
    of dozens of coffee shops I still need to visit, so maybe that should be my driving
    force.
- header: Take a trip outside of Brooklyn every 3 months
  body: I‘m proud to say that we traveled a fair amount this past year. We weren’t
    one of those couples who is constantly instagramming exotic locations around the
    world, but we at least got out of the city every three months—traveling to [Upstate
    New York](https://www.instagram.com/p/zAw0pACMQg/), [San Francisco](https://www.instagram.com/p/zTusdCiMbd),
    [Atlanta](https://www.instagram.com/p/1YGunbiMQX), [Portland](https://www.instagram.com/p/7qLvw9iMf8),
    and [West Virginia](https://www.instagram.com/p/-AA7UyCMTM). After reaching that
    goal, I realized that traveling every three months isn’t enough. For 2016, the
    new goal is to take four big trips with a few shorter trips in between. So far,
    we already have Joshua Tree and Palm Springs booked for February along with a
    week in Austin for July. And, I can guarantee that we’ll return to Portland again
    in the fall.
- header: In 2016
  body: Looking ahead, I plan to focus on quality of life. This doesn’t only mean
    experiencing more, but also taking care of myself. I need to slow down, work less,
    and reduce unnecessary stresses in my life.
- header: Embrace the freelance schedule
  body: Jen and I practically live at the studio with how much we work, so I want
    to battle that with a more flexible schedule. Instead of racing to the studio
    in the morning and zombie-walking home at night, I’d like to start a couple days
    a week without an agenda. Since we also tend to work the weekend, I want to start
    treating Wednesday like a mid-week weekend. Hopefully, that will break the week
    up better and help prevent those stretches when we forget to take time off. We
    really need to take advantage of the most appealing aspect of freelance—not having
    a schedule.
- header: Contribute to open source
  body: I know this entails more work, which is against my theme for 2016, but I feel
    the need to give back to the coding community. I try to write about my process
    and experiences as much as I can, but I haven’t really shared much code over the
    years. After years of coding in private, I miss having code out in the public
    for the world to reference and utilize. I’d be happy with even contributing the
    occasional one-line pull request.
- header: Spend time in the kitchen
  body: For those who don’t live in a tiny apartment or rely on Seamless for dinner,
    you might have a difficult time grasping the fact that we don’t use our kitchen.
    Now that we have a [new floor](https://www.instagram.com/p/-XHT2niMQN) and more
    space, I really want to spend more time in our “closet with a stove”. I’m not
    much of a cook, but I know I can follow a recipe. Even if this only results in
    cooking dinner once a week, I’d feel accomplished.
- header: Establish a better backup system
  body: For how cautious I am in real life, most people would be shocked to know that
    I don’t backup much of my data. All of my code is on Github and all of my other
    work is on Dropbox, but everything else is on a few hard drives that aren’t backed
    up anywhere. The plan for 2016 is to have a local RAID 0 hard drive system for
    working files in combination with [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/) backing
    up everything to the cloud. I know Murphy's Law can come into full effect at any
    moment with drive failures, so I need to make this priority one.
- header: Write 2016’s recap before New Year’s Eve
  body: Lastly, I want to write next year’s post with plenty of time to spare before
    the New Year. Here’s to 2016!
