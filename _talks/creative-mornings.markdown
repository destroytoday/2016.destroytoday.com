    In 2013, I spoke at [CreativeMornings](http://creativemornings.com), a breakfast lecture series for the creative community with over 100 chapters worldwide and growing. The New York venue was located several blocks from my previous studio space, so I was often in attendance. This time, however, I was fortunate enough to take the stage. Considering the month’s theme, “Make”, my talk focused on my dad and how he made me into the “maker” I am today.
