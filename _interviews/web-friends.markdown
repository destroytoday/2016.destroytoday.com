- body: Internet and real-life friend, [Garth Braithwaite](http://garthdb.com), invited
    me onto his aptly named podcast, [Web Friends](http://webfriends.io). I shared
    a handful of pro tips about freelancing and we reminisced about my apps from back
    in the day, like DestroyFlickr and DestroyTwitter. If you’re thinking of quitting
    your full-time job for the freelance world, but don’t really want to follow through,
    don’t listen to this interview.
