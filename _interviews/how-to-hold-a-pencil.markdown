    [Reuben Inger](http://twitter.com/reubeningber) invited me to join him on his podcast, [How to Hold a Pencil](http://howtoholdapencil.com/episode/017/), for an interview about how I started in the design/dev world. I also talked about taking the leap into freelancing and the fears and freedoms that come with it.
