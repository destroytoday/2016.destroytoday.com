[Cesar Contreras](https://twitter.com/pencilvspixel){:target='_blank'} invited me to join him on his podcast, [Pencil vs Pixel](http://pencilvspixel.com){:target='_blank'}. We talked about my freelancing app, [Cushion](http://cushionapp.com){:target='_blank'}â€”discussing topics including its origin story, my decision to run a paid beta, and trying to understand why someone [ripped it off](http://cushionapp.com/journal/inspiration-vs-imitation/){:target='_blank'}.
